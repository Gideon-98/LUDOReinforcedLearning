DISCOUNT FACTOR: our discount factor it basically just discounts the estimate of our optimal future value in the next state if we're taking that same action so here we can see that we take the action that maximizes the q value in the next state for this for the current action so we're actually taking one step ahead taking the maximum action of that and then we take a discount factor of that so we're trying to estimate optimal future value for the next uh state that we can that our agent will get in.
